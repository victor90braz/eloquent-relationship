## Relationship Types

This project illustrates the following Eloquent relationship types:

-   One-to-One
-   One-to-Many
-   Many-to-Many
-   Has-Many-Through
-   Polymorphic Relations

## Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/victor90braz/eloquent-relationship.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd eloquent-relationship
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies using Composer:

    ```shell
    composer install
    ```

4. Create a copy of the `.env` file and configure your database connection settings:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. Generate an application key:

    ```shell
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. Migrate the database to create the necessary tables:

    ```shell
    php artisan migrate
    ```

## Usage

### Create a Profile Schema and Migrate

Before demonstrating the relationships, you need to create a `profile` schema and migrate it to the database. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a migration for the `Profile` model:

    ```shell
    php artisan make:migration create_profiles_table
    ```

2. Open the newly created migration file at `database/migrations/yyyy_mm_dd_create_profiles_table.php` and define the schema for the `profiles` table.

3. Run the migration to create the `profiles` table:

    ```shell
    php artisan migrate
    ```

### Get a User's Profile

You can retrieve a user's profile using Laravel's Eloquent relationships. Here's an example of how to do it:

1. Start a Tinker session:

    ```shell
    php artisan tinker
    ```

2. Create a new `User` instance:

    ```php
    $user = new User();
    ```

3. Retrieve a user's profile by specifying the user's ID:

    ```php
    $profile = $user->find(2)->profile;
    ```

4. You can also log the SQL queries executed by the application using the following code:

    ```php
    DB::listen(function ($sql) {
        var_dump($sql->sql, $sql->bindings);
    });
    ```

    This will help you see the SQL queries generated by Eloquent.

For more detailed examples and usage of each relationship type, please refer to the provided code in this repository.

## DB Query Logging

To enable database query logging and see the SQL queries that are executed, you can use the `DB::listen` function. You can add the following code to your Tinker session or other parts of your Laravel application:

```php
DB::listen(function ($sql) {
    var_dump($sql->sql, $sql->bindings);
});
```

This will log the SQL queries and their bindings for debugging and analysis purposes.
